# sql-challenge-

This project involved importing employee data from a fictional company from the 1980s and 1990s into a SQL database. It included creating a schema that defined table constraints and relationships, and visualizing entity relationships in an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). The table schema incorporated primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships between entities.
